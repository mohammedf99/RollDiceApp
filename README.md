# roll_dice_app

A new Flutter app to referesh and update my knowledge.

## Things I revised:
- Dart language basics (variables, functions etc.)
- Widgets & Layouts in flutter
- Stateless and Stateful widgets
- using Random from math package
- splitting widgets
- use images
- use const and final to optimize the app in the best way possible
